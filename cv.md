## About Me:
  At the moment I have been working as a software-controlled machine tool adjuster since 2009.In 2020, he became interested in programming.I started to get acquainted with the C# programming language.I studied using literature and an application with training courses (Stepic).I didn't like the syntax in C#.
  
  In parallel with the study of C #, they suggested trying to take an interest in front-end development.I started learning HTML, CSS.  I studied HTML based on materials on various websites. I studied CSS from the book "The Big Book of CSS". I really liked this direction.

  На данный момент изучаю JavaScript с помощью сайта [learn.javascript.ru](https://learn.javascript.ru).
